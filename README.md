# Code-Daddies-team

Do you ever feel like you take the same route every day?

The same streets…

The same corners…

The same scenes…

We wanted to give ourselves a reason to break free from our routines, and see something new. So we built ourselves a fun little tool to encourage us to explore, calculate how much we’ve seen… and how much we still have to discover!

Made with love for the FCC Hackathon in Chengdu!
